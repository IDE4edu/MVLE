            <div class="feedback"> Computers are much, much faster than this! Almost everything a computer does involves adding numbers together.  Even drawing a simple shape can make a computer add hundreds or thousands of numbers together.</div>
            <div class="text">It can add them together about once a second.</div>

            <div class="feedback">Computers are faster than this!  The UNIVAC, first made in 1951, could add 100,000 ten-digit numbers together each second.</div>
            <div class="text">It can add them together about 1,000 times a second.</div>

            <div class="feedback">his answer is closest to correct.  However, different computers can vary widely in their computational power.  An iPhone may be cool but its processor gets owned by a Sun workstation. And, even being able to add 100,000,000 numbers a second is <b>not</b> instantly; many problems require much, much more adding than that.</div>
